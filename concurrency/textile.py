Problem: Multi-Stage Textile Factory Simulation
You are tasked with simulating a multi-stage textile factory using concurrency. The factory has three stages of processing:

Spinners - Spin raw cotton into thread.
Weavers - Weave thread into cloth.
Packagers - Fold and package the cloth.
The factory must obey the following constraints:

There are:
S Spinner threads
W Weaver threads
P Packager threads

A spinner produces one thread unit at a time.
A weaver consumes two thread units to produce one cloth unit.
A packager consumes one cloth unit to produce one package.

The simulation must run continuously, with each worker looping infinitely (or until a specified total number of packages is made, for testability).

Concurrency Constraints:
Semaphores must be used to manage access to shared buffers:
- A thread buffer (bounded buffer of max size T) for holding thread units.
- A cloth buffer (bounded buffer of max size C) for holding cloth units.
You must avoid:
- Race conditions (i.e., protect buffer accesses)
- Deadlocks
- Resource starvation
Workers should block if they can't continue their work (e.g., a weaver must block if there are fewer than two threads available).
Efficient use of threads â€” workers should not spin-wait.
